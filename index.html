  <H1>K6BP Rigcontrol Web Firmware Installer</H1>
  <P>To install the Rigcontrol firmware, connect the Rigcontrol
  board to a computer via USB, and run a web browser on that same
  computer.</P>
  <P>You must use a <A href=
  "https://www.google.com/chrome/downloads/">Chrome</A> or <A href=
  "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge">Edge</A> web browser.<BR>
  You must use Windows, MacOS, or Linux.<BR>
  And you must use the <B>https</B> version of <I>this</I> page,
  plain http won't work. <A href=

  <P>Connect your Rigcontrol board via USB. Use the <B>top</B> USB
  connector on the Rigcontrol board. That will provide <I>both</I>
  data and power.</P>
  <P>When the installer asks what serial port you wish to use,
  select the one with a <B>CP201 USB to UART Bridge Controller</B>,
  that is the USB chip on the Rigcontrol board.</P>
  <P>If the installer asks if you want to erase the device, say
  <B>yes</B> if you are installing <I>K6BP Rigcontrol</I> for the
  first time, or if there is a different program currently
  installed on the device. This will erase any saved settings.</P>
  <P>Push the button below to start the installer.</P>
  <p>When installation is done, use the menu option to configure the board's WiFi
  parameters.</p>

  <UL>
    <LI>If you can't access the card, unplug and reconnect its USB
    interface. Sometimes, it's necessary to remove and restore
    power to the USB hub the card is connected to.</LI>
    <LI>The first time you run this, you may have to grant yourself
    permission to open serial ports on your computer. You'll only
    need to do this once per user and computer.<BR>
      <P>On <B>Linux</B> use the command</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <SPAN style="font-family: monospace">sudo adduser</SPAN>
        <I>your-user-name</I> <SPAN style=
        "font-family: monospace">dialout</SPAN>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>Then log out, and in again.
      <P>On <B>MacOS</B>, use these commands:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <SPAN style="font-family: monospace">sudo dseditgroup -o
        edit -a</SPAN> <I>your-user-name</I> <SPAN style=
        "font-family: monospace">-t user wheel</SPAN><BR>
        <SPAN style="font-family: monospace">sudo dseditgroup -o
        edit -a</SPAN> <I>your-user-name</I> <SPAN style=
        "font-family: monospace">-t user admin</SPAN>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>Then log out, and in again.
      <P>If you are running <B>Windows</B>, the system may ask for
      permission to access the serial device. Give it.</P>
      <P>Restricting permission to access serial ports was
      important when they were used for dial-out telephone modems.
      It's still there today.</P>

  <P>See the <A href=
  "https://github.com/BrucePerens/rigcontrol">Github page</A> for
  information on the Rigcontrol project.</P>
  <P>The "Rigcontrol" board is actually an <I>ESP32-Audio-Kit</I>
  board made by <I>AI Thinker</I>. It becomes <I>K6BP
  Rigcontrol</I> when our firmware is installed.</P>
